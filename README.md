### Abstract

Causal mediation analysis has provided numerous tools for defining and
estimating effects that may be endowed with mechanistic interpretations. Owing
to the close alignment of such causal direct and indirect effects with the
goals of modern scientific investigations, the natural direct and indirect
effects have risen to enormous popularity in applications of causal mediation
analysis. Unfortunately, these canonical causal effects have stringent
requirements for their identification, making their practical use limited. As a
result, considerable effort has been invested in developing alternative direct
and indirect effect decompositions with relaxed identification requirements,
yet such efforts often yield effect definitions with nuanced and challenging
interpretations. By contrast, relatively limited attention has been paid to
relaxing the identification assumptions of the natural direct and indirect
effects. We present a theoretical study of the identification of the natural
direct effect under unobserved baseline confounding of exposure-outcome and
exposure-mediator pathways. Our novel identification strategy reveals that
this causal effect may be learned even when the total causal effect remains
unidentified. Using an intervention strategy that relaxes the commonly used but
restrictive cross-world counterfactual independence assumption, we discuss how
the natural direct effect may be assessed in randomized controlled trials.
Revisiting prior studies of non/semi-parametric efficiency theory required for
the construction of flexible, multiply robust estimators of the natural direct
effect, we discuss its efficient estimation without imposing restrictive
modeling assumptions on nuisance parameters.
